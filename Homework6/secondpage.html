        <h1>My Short Story</h1>
        <p>This is a charcoal sketch of my window.
        There are a couple of pine trees and several oak trees.
        The trees are very active with robins and tons of crows.
        Squirrels also add to the chipper chatter throughout the day.
        It's very peaceful to see the sun start to rise and hear the birds
        in the trees wake up little by little. I love the view outside of my window.
